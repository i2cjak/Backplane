# Type-check every Bend file, then prove every law. CI runs exactly this.
#
# Usage: scripts/check.sh [all|check|proof]
#   all (default): type-check, then prove
#   check:         type-check only (CI's check job)
#   proof:         prove only, i.e. bend PROOF.bend (CI's proof job)
#
# The type-check no longer runs `bend FILE --check-only` once per file.
# Bend checks every def of every file a program imports (verified on
# 2.0.25: a type error in an unused def of an imported file fails the
# importer's check), so scripts/check-manifest.py generates a few
# manifest files that between them import every tracked .bend file
# exactly once, and only the manifests are checked. Coverage is proven
# mechanically on every run: generation and a separate re-read both
# fail unless the manifests' imports are exactly the tracked files.
# LAWS.bend is still checked on its own, so its TODO handling below is
# unchanged, and PROOF.bend is still run as its own program. If a
# manifest check fails, every file is checked individually, as before,
# so the report names the file that is broken.
#
# CHECK_JOBS: parallel bend processes (default: nproc/4, at least 1,
# at most 6; CI sets it to the runner's core count). CHECK_SHARDS:
# number of manifests (default: 1; one manifest already loads each
# file's source only once, so extra shards only trade more total work
# and memory for parallelism when the single check is the bottleneck).
# CHECK_FILES (check mode only): type-check exactly these tracked .bend
# files (space or newline separated) instead of all of them, for a caller
# that keeps per-file results (bp-coord's local-ci). Each must be one of
# the tracked files; an unknown one, a repeat or an empty list stops it
# (exit 2). The manifests then cover exactly the selection, verified the
# same way, and LAWS.bend is checked only when it is selected. A selection
# is never recorded as the whole check passing.
