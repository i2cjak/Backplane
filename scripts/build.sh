# Build into dist/:
#   dist/backplane        the app: native window + hub + web server
#   dist/backplane-serve  hub + web server only (no X11 needed)
#   dist/web/             the web client (for other devices)
#   dist/backplane-browser, dist/backplane-step2glb, dist/backplane-voice
#                         host helpers (with bun)
# X11 headers: /usr/include (libx11-dev), or BACKPLANE_X11=<prefix> holding
# include/ and lib/libX11.so (see AGENTS.md).
# System fonts (src/gfx/effects/font.c) need no headers and no link flags:
# libfreetype.so.6 and libfontconfig.so.1 are dlopen'd at run time and the
# few FreeType structs read are declared in font.c; without them text falls
# back to the Spleen bitmap font. To re-check those struct layouts against
# real headers without root:
#   apt-get download libfreetype-dev && dpkg -x libfreetype-dev_*.deb ~/.local/ft
#   (headers in ~/.local/ft/usr/include/freetype2; compare offsetof values)
#
# A macOS runner's 7 GB is too little for bend's emit, so releases split
# the build (.github/workflows/release.yml): `scripts/build.sh emit` on
# Linux writes what is the same everywhere (the web client, the server's C
# and test/wire for smoke.sh), and `BACKPLANE_PREBUILT=1 scripts/build.sh`
# on the Mac compiles it.
