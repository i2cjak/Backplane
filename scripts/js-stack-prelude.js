// The hub's stack, set before anything runs (scripts/build-js.sh puts this
// first in the compiled backplane-serve, ahead of the baked prelude).
//
// Bend's JS walks over large data recurse deeply, and Bun bounds its JS stack
// by two things, both needed: the main thread's RLIMIT_STACK (the kernel
// places the stack from it at exec, so it cannot be raised afterwards) and
// BUN_JSC_maxPerThreadStackUsage (read once at start). With 8 MiB a compiled
// bun reaches ~40k frames; with a 4 GiB soft limit and 4e9 ~31M (an
// unlimited soft limit makes JSC bound itself small again). So when either
// is short, the hub raises the soft limit to 4 GiB, sets the variable and
// executes itself again, once (BACKPLANE_STACK_SET marks the second run).
// It is the first code in the binary: nothing (the hub lock, a socket, an
// adopted agent) is open yet. With the limit and the variable already set
// (the service's LimitSTACK, an exec in place) it does nothing; with only the
// limit set it still executes once, as JSC reads the variable only at
// start. The hub's own children (--plot, --review, --telemetry-pow) raise
// theirs the same way: they parse large files too.
// Stack pages are only committed when touched. Children are started with
// 8 MiB again (host.js's host_child_stack). Sys.exec in place keeps both, so
// a restart does not repeat this.
//
// The same exec sets the hub's memory budget for JSC (also read only at
// start): BUN_JSC_forceRAMSize makes the collector size its heap and collect
// for that much RAM instead of the machine's, so a hub held to 1 GB (the
// service's MemoryMax) is not killed by garbage the collector had not yet
// gone for (the store's hot load peaked past 1 GB with ~0.4 GB live).
// BACKPLANE_RAM_BUDGET_MB says how much (768 for the hub, 640 for its
// --store-rebuild, --plot ... children by default; 0 leaves JSC its own
// guess); a BUN_JSC_forceRAMSize already set is kept.
//
// Only a compiled hub on Linux or macOS (process.argv[1] under /$bunfs/):
// `bun serve.js` and the tests run as they are. macOS's hard stack limit is
// usually 64 MiB, below 4 GiB: there it takes what the hard limit allows. Anything
// failing (no ffi, setrlimit or execve refused) runs on, never exits.
