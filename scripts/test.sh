# Run every test program. A test prints lines "ok ..." or "FAIL ..." and the
# script fails when any FAIL appears or a test exits non-zero.
#
# Tests now run in parallel (TEST_JOBS at a time), each exactly as
# before: standalone IO tests use `bend TEST`, and fixtures with a matching
# test/tools/NAME.mjs driver are emitted and exercised by that driver. A
# file with both an IO main and a driver runs both. Keep the same strict
# per-test verdict applied to its full output (a test must exit 0,
# print at least one "^ok " line, print no "^Error:" line, and print
# no "^FAIL" line). Outputs are collected per test and replayed in
# the original alphabetical order, so the report is deterministic
# whatever order the tests finish in.
#
# TEST_JOBS: parallel tests (default: nproc/4, at least 1, at most 6,
# each capped with BUN_JSC_forceRAMSize=4294967296 and nice 19; CI
# sets it to the runner's core count).
# TEST_SHARD / TEST_SHARD_COUNT: run only shard TEST_SHARD (1-based)
# of TEST_SHARD_COUNT, assigned by recorded duration, longest first,
# via scripts/test-shard.py and scripts/test-timings.txt. A test with
# no recorded duration still runs, in exactly one shard (the shard
# script verifies the partition covers every test exactly once).
# TEST_ONLY: run exactly these tests (paths "test/X_test.bend", separated
# by spaces or newlines; TEST_ONLY_FILE names a file of them), in the usual
# order, under the same verdicts. Each must be one of the tests above: an
# unknown name, a repeat or an empty list stops the run (exit 2) before any
# test starts. A selection is never recorded as the whole suite passing.
# TEST_TIMINGS_OUT: when set, per-test wall seconds are written there
# as "<seconds> <path>" lines (scripts/record-test-timings.sh uses it
# to regenerate scripts/test-timings.txt from a serial run).
