# Install Backplane

Download the Linux x64 AppImage from [Backplane Releases](https://github.com/i2cjak/Backplane/releases).
The desktop app includes its Chromium browser, server, Python, the matching Backplane KiCad runtime, and the official KiCad symbols, footprints, 3D models, and project templates.
You do not need to install Chrome, Node.js, Python, or KiCad separately.

Make the downloaded AppImage executable in your file manager, then open it.
If your system cannot mount AppImages, launch it from a terminal with
`--appimage-extract-and-run`.

Berkeley Mono is used when installed locally. Backplane includes no Berkeley Mono
font files and falls back to your system monospace font.

## First run

Backplane stores its threads and settings in `~/.backplane/userdata`, separately
from T3 Code. It starts with an empty workspace and does not import T3 Code's
sessions or settings. You can keep both apps installed and running.
To choose a different Backplane data directory, set `BACKPLANE_HOME` before
launching it. Backplane ignores `T3CODE_HOME`.

Open **Settings → Providers**, enable your coding provider, and follow its
installation and sign-in instructions. Provider accounts and any required
provider CLI are separate from the Backplane installer.

Open your project directory and start a thread. PCB, schematic, Gerber, and 3D
files appear in the project's KiCad views.

## Updates

Download the newer AppImage from the same releases page, close Backplane, and
replace the previous AppImage. Your saved threads and settings remain in your
user data directory.

The initial release supports Linux x64. Native Windows and macOS installers and
Backplane mobile store releases are not available yet.

For source builds, see the [development instructions](../../README.md#develop).
