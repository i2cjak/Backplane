# Safe deploy and restart

A restart is cheap: with `restart.continue` on (the default) the hub resumes
every turn it cut. What a restart must not cut is a **tool call in flight** (a
build, an edit) and a **build under way** (the machine-wide `/tmp/bp-bend.lock`
and `/tmp/bp-wt-build.lock` that builds hold). A deploy waits
for both, then swaps the new package in and restarts in place.

## Asking

- An agent: the `deploy_restart {stage?, note?}` MCP tool. It answers at once
  ("scheduled") and the agent ends its turn; after the restart it is woken by
  one message, "Backplane restarted for a deploy ...: <from> → <to>."
  `deploy_status` and `deploy_cancel` read and cancel it.
- A client (the person): the requests `deploy.restart {stage?, note?}`,
  `deploy.cancel` and `deploy.status`.
- `scripts/dev.sh install [h@host]`: builds, stages the package and posts
  `deploy_restart` to the running hub's loopback MCP route
  (`POST /mcp/deploy`; "deploy" is no thread, so the person is the requester).
  It prints "deploy queued" and ends. With no hub answering, or with
  `--force`, it installs and restarts now, as before.

`stage` is an absolute folder holding the package (`backplane`,
`backplane-serve`, `web/`, ...). Empty means the files are already in place.

## How it waits

The request is the private setting `deploy.wait`, one JSON line (`by`, `note`,
`stage`, `from`, `since`, `noted`, `locked`, `open`). Each tick, while it waits:

1. The hub's open tool calls, in memory only (core/deploy.bend `Open.*`; the
   server's `Bn.tools`). A call opens where its Act is posted (`ToolOpen`:
   Claude's `tool_use` block, Codex's `item.started`, Grok's/Muse's logged
   call) and shuts at its result (`ToolShut`: the `tool_result` block, Codex's
   `item.completed`, ACP's `tool.done`); a turn's end, an archive, a delete or a
   stopped agent shuts every call of the thread (`ToolsGone`). None of it is in
   the log, and after a restart the list is empty (the old processes are
   gone). A thread between two calls has none open, so a deploy goes then,
   however long its turn. The requester's own `deploy_*` call is never opened;
   a subagent's Agent/Task call stays open until its result. The wait line
   records what was open at the last look (`open`) for the plane row,
   `deploy_status` and the 30-minute note.
2. With none, the server asks the locks (`flock -n` on each path of
   `BACKPLANE_DEPLOY_LOCKS`, colon-separated, default the two build locks;
   without flock(1) they count as free) and answers `Deploy.check`.
3. Clear: `deploy.done` is written (the same line plus the threads cut) and
   `deploy.wait` cleared in one step, then the server moves the staged package
   into the running install's folder as `scripts/dev.sh`'s `install_into` does
   (renames; the old `web/` is kept as `web.old`) and restarts the hub in
   place (the updater's `Upgrade.restart`, same PID). A failed swap clears
   `deploy.done` and tells the requester; nothing restarts.
4. After 30 minutes the requester is told once what still blocks.

The Status plane shows a "Restart pending" row in Running while one waits
("waiting for 2 tool calls and the build lock · Cancel"; a click cancels:
action `deploy-cancel`), and Settings' update line says the same.

## After

At start `Deploy.after` reads `deploy.done`: it clears it and tells the
requester once. A thread the restart cut gets the words appended to its
continue message instead (`Deploy.suffix` in `Carry.k`), so no thread gets two.

## Deploying origin/main

Restarting into a new build is the hub's job, not any one agent's. The
`deploy_main {note?}` MCP tool (and `POST /mcp/deploy` from loopback, which is
the person) asks this hub to build origin/main and restart into it through
the safe path above. Pure logic: `src/core/ship.bend`; steps: hub.bend's
`Ship.*`; IO: server.bend's `ShipJob.*`.

Settings (all off or empty by default):

- `deploy.repo`: the source checkout to build from. Unset, the tool answers
  "not configured" and nothing runs.
- `deploy.wrap`: a command prefix the build runs under, e.g.
  `~/Documents/i2cjak/bp-coord/bin/bp-admit.sh --mem 14 --cores 4 -- systemd-run --user --scope -q -p MemoryMax=16G --`.
  Resource policy lives there, never in the hub. Empty means
  `systemd-run --user --scope -q --` when the user's systemd answers, else
  nothing.
- `deploy.follow`: `on` makes the hub read origin/main on every minute's
  tick (when nothing is under way) and deploy when it moved: for a
  development install that tracks main. Merges coalesce only while a build
  runs: the first tick after it takes the newest main (law
  `ship_follow_every_minute`). Each deploy restarts the hub (about two
  minutes of it not answering while it replays its log). Off, it does no
  work at all.

A main-track install whose desktop app requires an exact release version
(the 0.12 Electron app checks the service reports exactly `0.12.0`) builds
the service alone, stamped with that release, by putting the environment in
`deploy.wrap`, e.g.
`env BACKPLANE_DEV_SERVICE_ONLY=1 BACKPLANE_VERSION_STAMP=0.12.0 ~/Documents/i2cjak/bp-coord/bin/bp-admit.sh --mem 14 --cores 4 --`.
Every build stamps the commit it was made from beside the version
(`BACKPLANE_COMMIT_STAMP`, `scripts/dev.sh` sets it), and `GET /hello`
answers it as `"commit"`, so builds with the same version are told apart.

What happens:

1. The server fetches origin/main in `deploy.repo` (off the hub loop) and asks
   git which of the commits being built, staged (while its deploy still
   waits) and live contain it (`merge-base --is-ancestor`).
2. The tool answers at once: **skipped** when one of them covers it (the answer
   names the commit and whether it is building, staged or live), **queued**
   otherwise. One build runs at a time. Requests that a running build does
   not cover make one follow-up build, of the newest origin/main then, however
   many came.
3. The build is a job of its own under `<home>/deploy/<commit>/`: a temporary
   detached worktree of the repo (`wt`, removed after), `scripts/dev.sh stage
   <dir>/pkg` (the build and stage steps of `dev.sh install`, nothing
   installed and no hub asked), the log `out`, the exit status `code`. It is
   started with `setsid`, inside `deploy.wrap` (or the default scope), so a hub
   OOM or the restart it leads to never cuts it. Its pid and start time are
   recorded (`DeployBuilt` state `pid`). Stale worktrees of ended builds are
   removed at the next launch.
4. The hub looks at the job every 5 s. Exit 0 with a package: staged, and the
   hub asks for the safe restart itself (`deploy.wait`, note
   `deploy_main <commit>`, by the person). A deploy does not wait for a
   deploy_main build: the build runs in its own scope with `BP_BUILD_LOCKED=1`
   (it holds no build lock), so a restart never cuts it, and the next hub
   re-adopts it (step 6). Anything else: failed, with the log's last lines.
5. Everyone who asked since the last report is told once, with the commit,
   the version and the result: a thread the way watched work reaches it (it
   wakes, or the note waits behind its turn); the person with an alert
   (record `alert.deploy`). Skipped requests covered by the build under way
   are told at its end.
6. At start, a build that was under way is watched again: its job outlived the
   hub, and its exit status is read when it ends. It is "lost" (failed) only
   when its process is gone and it left no exit status. A follow-up still
   wanted is asked for again. The restart a staged build asked for makes it
   live.

State: the events `DeployAsked{by, note, commit, cover}` and
`DeployBuilt{commit, state, version, detail}` (states building, pid, staged,
failed, skipped, live), folded into the setting `deploy.ship`.
`deploy_status` (and the `deploy.status` request) answer it under `main`.
