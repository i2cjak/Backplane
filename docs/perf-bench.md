# Perf bench: the window and hub under load

`test/tools/perf_load.ts` runs the native app (hub and window in one
process) on a copy of a real event log, with stand-in agents streaming, and
measures it phase by phase against the targets. Keep one immutable log
snapshot for a baseline/change comparison; each report records its byte
count and SHA-256 so different inputs are visible:

```sh
cp ~/.backplane-bend/events.jsonl /tmp/backplane-perf-snapshot.jsonl
bun test/tools/perf_load.ts --bin build/backplane --log /tmp/backplane-perf-snapshot.jsonl --out /tmp/perf-result.json
```

| target | metric |
|---|---|
| frame p99 ≤ 8 ms | `ui.frame` |
| no frame > 16 ms from background streaming | `ui.frame` in `idle` and `bg` |
| typing ≤ 16 ms | `ui.input` in `type` and `normal` (also shown: key>frame) |
| key handling through frame ≤ 16 ms | `ui.msg.win` + `ui.input` in `type` and `normal` |
| thread open ≤ 50 ms | Return in the palette to the frame showing the thread |
| agent line ≤ 2 ms | `hub.agent_line` p99 |

## Running it

```sh
bun test/tools/perf_load.ts --bin build/backplane --out /tmp/perf.json
# needs the native window and xpoke, which are no longer built (no C)
```

Options: `--bin` (any branch's build), `--log` (default
`~/.backplane-bend/events.jsonl`, only read), `--port` (3799), `--display`
(`:77`; an Xvfb is started there if none runs, from `/tmp/xvfb-root`,
`/usr/bin` or `~/.local/bin`, see "Xvfb without root" below), `--agents`
(10), `--secs` (20 per phase), `--phases` (any of
`normal,idle,bg,fg,type,open,plane`), `--out` (raw JSON: every phase's
stats, top 25 spans, both perf.json readings), `--shots DIR` (a screenshot
at the end of each phase), `--keep` (keep the temp folder), `--hold` (set up,
start streaming and wait for `<tmp>/stop`, to look around by hand).
One run takes about 4 minutes.

`--fail-on-target` exits nonzero when a selected phase misses a target or
has no samples for a required metric. The default records failures and
exits successfully, which permits before/after runs while improving a
known slow build. Neither typing metric includes time spent waiting
before the window handles an event; these are processing measurements,
not complete input-to-pixels latency. The Status plane is selected by
its sidebar coordinates; include `--shots` when checking UI coverage.

The copied log's provider preference is overridden with the deterministic
stand-in protocol, including bot threads. Before timing begins, every load
thread must deliver parsed streaming deltas. Each streaming phase reports
per-thread delta counts and fails the workload if a thread falls below one
delivered update a second and now also records the longest receive gap
(at most two seconds, including both phase edges). Every local bot in
every posted room must respond during a normal-use run. Zero or dead
streams, unexpected provider processes and failed input commands make a
run invalid regardless of timing targets. `bun test/tools/perf_standin_test.ts`
checks the stand-in's JSON, deltas, subagent and shell events without a hub.
`bun test/tools/perf_guard_test.ts` rejects bursts followed by dead streams,
phase-edge gaps and partial/missing thread-open samples.

Thread opens must be observed through the native client's existing
`desk.look` selection reports, with ten complete timing windows in the
open phase. The same report can establish the uberbot selection, but not
which tab it rendered. Status-tab coverage therefore remains explicitly
unverified and cannot pass strict mode; screenshots remain necessary for
that visual check.

## What it measures

The app runs with `BACKPLANE_TRACE`, so every span is in a trace with its
exact duration. Each phase is bounded by two `/debug/perf.json` readings;
their `proc.up_ms` is the trace's clock, so a phase's numbers are exactly the
spans inside it (percentiles are exact, not log2 buckets). cpu% is the whole
app process (hub and window) from `/proc`; hub% is the time in `hub.*`
spans over the wall time (how busy the hub's loop was); rss is the most seen.

key>frame adds the `ui.msg.win` that handled a key to its `ui.input` (which
starts after the handling, docs/perf.md). Neither has the time an event
waited in the queue before it was handled.

## Phases (run in this order, `normal` printed first)

- `idle`: the window on the longest real thread, nothing streaming: the
  caret's blink and nothing else.
- `bg`: 10 threads stream at once (6 with a subagent writing its own lines
  and a background shell, each with a progress line every 100 ms); the person
  posts in every room that has bots every 4 s, so bots wake and stream; the
  window stays on the long thread (nothing on screen changes).
- `fg`: the window on a streaming thread, its Subagents panel at work.
- `type`: 60 keys typed into that thread's composer, 8 a second, then
  deleted.
- `open`: 10 real threads (the next longest) opened one after another:
  ctrl+k, the title, Return. Only the Return is timed.
- `plane`: the uberbot's Status plane (its row at the top of the sidebar),
  wheel over it.
- `normal`: everything at once, as in a day's use: agents, subagents and
  bots streaming, typing in a streaming thread, scrolling it, opening the
  long thread and scrolling up, typing there, the Status plane, back to a
  streaming thread and typing.

The stand-in agent is a shell script speaking Claude's stream-json (3 text
deltas per 100 ms, every 3 s a finished paragraph, a Bash call and its
result). Threads are found by title through the palette: the long thread and
the 10 to open get unique titles (`zqlong`, `zqopena`..) appended to the copy.

## Safety

- The log is copied. Dropped: `DeviceRegistered`/`DeviceDropped`, hooks,
  peers, wakes, routines, locks, watched work, and push/voice/deploy/google
  settings. Delegated tasks still open are closed, `restart.continue` is off.
- Every path under the user's home is rewritten into the temp folder, so no
  thread's folder is a real one; `git`, `gh`, `claude` (the stand-in),
  `codex`, `grok`, `muse`, `notify-send`... on PATH are the bench's own. No
  repository, no live home, no phone is touched.
- HOME, the lock dir and the deploy locks are in the temp folder; the D-Bus
  address is a dead one.
- It refuses port 3787 and the installed binary, aborts if a child agent is
  not the stand-in, and stops only the PIDs it started (the app, and Xvfb if
  it started one). The stand-ins end when their hub is gone.

## Xvfb without root

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/xvfb-deb && cd /tmp/xvfb-deb && apt-get download xvfb && dpkg -x xvfb_*.deb /tmp/xvfb-root
```

## Not covered

The web client: it needs the web bundle and a Chromium; not timed here.

Mailroom is an opt-in `--phases mail` workload. It files 5,000 conversations
and 50,000 bodies across six synthetic bots through `mail.send`, with
`mail.on` enabled only in the temporary home. Filing finishes and a list
plus a body read are verified before the timed phase. The phase scrolls
40 rows, types `needle`, opens ten conversations, then sends two mails per
second while the uberbot's Chat tab is selected. `--mail-convs N` and
`--mail-mails N` permit explicitly smaller smoke runs; the report records
those counts, so a smoke run cannot be mistaken for the full fixture.

The JSON includes `mail_read_rpc_ms` (real body-read roundtrips) separately
from `opens_ms` (native input processing through its frame). Native tab
coverage still needs the screenshots: the existing `desk.look` report
identifies the bot's thread but does not expose its tab or open mail.
The Mailroom pane reuses PW with `Mm.mail` as its key. Bot panes bypass
MainM, so the existing `ui.layout.mm.hit` metric does not measure that
pane cache; do not claim Mailroom cache hit coverage from that metric.
